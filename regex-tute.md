# Email Regex

In this tutorial, I will be covering what a Regex (Regular Expression) is in programming, and include a specific example. Regex are a series of characters that are used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regex function as objects. They are commonly used as text processing and manipulation, and by forming search patterns with regex, we can make it easy and efficient to search for data.

## Summary

The regex covered in this tutorial allows for email validation. This email regex comprised of a group of characters that are typical of the standard email address. Email validation is an important part of the UX of a web application, and ensuring only valid information is inputted in web forms and sent to the server is vital. 

Matching an Email: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
